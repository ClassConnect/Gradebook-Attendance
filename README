Rails form bug:

Not all browsers support PUT/DELETE with Javascript, which is why JQuery only has
$.post and $.get. You can pass data in with data set to {_method: 'put'}; however,
this messes up the form. The proper way to do it is use :remote => true and in the :html hash,
include :method => "put". 

Lesson learned: always push to github before bed.
Git is acting weird. I am tired of typing in my password.
